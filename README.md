# Predicting Student At-Risk Status Using Early-Semester Grade and Engagement Data

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies students at risk of academic failure early in the semester.  By analyzing early-semester grade data and student engagement metrics, the model aims to proactively identify at-risk students, allowing for timely interventions and ultimately improving student retention rates.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and potentially the chosen model's feature importances.  Additionally, the script may generate visualization files (e.g., plots showing grade distributions, correlations between variables, or model performance curves) which will be saved in the `output` directory.  The exact output will depend on the specific model and analysis performed.  Refer to the Jupyter Notebook(s) for a more detailed analysis and interpretation of results.


## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing early-semester grades and engagement metrics for students.  This dataset is not included in this repository due to [state reason, e.g., privacy concerns, size limitations].  Please contact [contact information] for potential access to the data.
